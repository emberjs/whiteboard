# Whiteboard
This repo serves as a home for experimental projects and efforts, efforts, proposals, etc.

Things like design updates, major marketing efforts, theoretical explorations of docs and code, tend to spring up more often than they succeed. This is normal; there are tough challenges with big multi-faceted projects! 

This is a public location for things to live while they're in the ideas phase, where folks can collaborate. Should a project in this repo reach maturity, it can be moved, an RFC created, etc.—whatever the next logical steps are to go from idea to reality.

Currently, members of the Ember Core Team and Learning Team have permissions to manage this repo. New efforts should be on new separate branches, and community members should request new branches be created for their efforts as needed.

This repo exists in a somewhat middling state of officialness :p Think of it like a whiteboarding session. Something appearing here does not neccessarily indicate official approval, though some things here probably _do_ have the attention of the Core Team; it simply means that at some point someone on the team agreed that the initial form of the material was worth exploring. 

Should an effort reach the stage where it can be rolled into official Ember materials, it will likely relocate. 

Current whiteboard-phase efforts that will live in this repo:

1. Website redesign project
2. New marketing effort targeted at larger companies 

Like all things Ember, everything is open-source, and contributions and suggestions are welcome. As per usual Pull Requests are the way to go, and as per etiquette, it's best to mention what you're wanting to work on before diving in full steam, so we avoid duplication of efforts. Most robust efforts will also end up with some related Slack channel where you'll likely be able to find primary contributors available to chat.
